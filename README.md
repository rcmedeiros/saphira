This is the simplest and most opinionated Typescript Framework I could devise. It's opinionated to enforce [Convention over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration), and it's simple because it only expects a single approach for anything. I also intend to keep it as [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) sa it can be.

I wrote it for myself to be able to write microservices swiftly and ready to connect to all interfaces a microservice might have to.

It's not production ready though. It'll be when I write a scaffolding system. I don't want anybody learning anything besides simple usage.
