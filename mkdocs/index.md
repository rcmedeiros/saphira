# Stark Docs

At first I had this project privately to myself where I could copy-and-paste already sorted out configurations to other projects, I think everyone has one of those. Now it's public and others can take advantage of it.

Docs were written for coders in a rush, but I'll try to balance the amount of information not to be too vague. I just want you to copy-and-paste something that actually works without too much reading. References to full documentation are always included for deep dive later on with time.
